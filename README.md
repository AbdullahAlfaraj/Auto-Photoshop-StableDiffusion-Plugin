# FAQ and Known Issues
## What Photoshop version do I need to run the plugin?
The minimum Photoshop version that the plugin supports is Photoshop v24

## Plugin Load Failed
There are a few issues that can result in this error, please follow the instructions for the corresponding error message in the UDT logs

### No application are connected to the service
This error occurs when Photoshop is not started before the plugin is attempted to be loaded. Simply start photoshop then restart UXP and load the plugin


## Exception in ASGI application / Expecting value: line 1 column 1
This error occurs due to mismatched expectations between the plugin and the Automatic1111 backend. 
It can be solved by both updating the version of the Automatic111 backend to the latest verion, and making sure "Save text information about generation parameters as chunks to png files" setting is enabled within the UI.

## No Generations and Plugin Server doesn't send messages. (Remote setup)
This error occurs when the remote server does not have the api enabled. You can verify this by attempting to go to the URL you access the webui at and appending "/docs#" to the end of the url. If you have permissions, make relaunch the remote instance with the "--api" flag. 

# No GPU Options:
we provide two options to use the auto-photoshp plugin without GPU.
